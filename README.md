# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset. It is a historical dataset documenting one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The goal is to explore factors influencing survival and build a machine learning model to predict passenger survival.

## About the Dataset

On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the loss of 1,502 lives from a total of 2,224 passengers and crew. The dataset highlights survival factors that varied among different groups.
Purpose:
To analyze the impact of variables such as age, gender, and class on survival and predict survival outcomes for passengers.

## Key Features

* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
* Model Training: Implementation of machine learning algorithms with proper hyperparameter tuning.
* Evaluation: Performance metrics and visualizations to interpret model accuracy.
* Visualizations: Charts and plots for data exploration and result presentation.

## Libraries

pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mlxtend, scikit-learn and any others specified in the notebook.


## Future Enhancements

* Extend analysis to include additional datasets or models.
* Automate parts of the workflow for scalability.
* Improve visualization with interactive tools (eg, Plotly, Dash)
